## Open source in action

A small batch of examples of open source in action. Compiled by [Eric Mill](https://twitter.com/konklone).

### Examples

Nicole Fenton, a member of the public, saw the White House's digital service playbook and decided to make it read better for ordinary people.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau engineering team launched a developer blog. I wanted to subscribe to their posts, but it didn't include an RSS feed -- so I built one for them.

18F's team working on online immigration services is using a public open source library ("searchkick") to build a powerful search engine. 18F pushed its limits and tested out an experimental approach with improved performance. They submitted their research and a patch to searchkick, which was accepted and thus improved the project for anyone using it.

Waldo Jaquith spontaneously optimized the image files 18F's website uses, making our website load more quickly and efficiently.

Josh Tauberer, Derek Willis, and I began several open source projects that track and collect congressional data.

Connor Walsh, at the time a staff member for Rep. Eric Cantor, added a missing official Twitter account for Rep. Frelinghuysen.

A volunteer came along and completely revamped how we collect photos of members of Congress, creating a valuable service for easy integration of high quality photos. Members of civil society joined in the discussion and helped confirm the licensing status of the work with GPO.
